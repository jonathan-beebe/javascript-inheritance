Javascript Inheritance
======================

What is this?
-------------

This is a playground for javascript inheritance, and using
getters and setters within class definitions.

Is it useful?
-------------

When I really need inheritance in javascript, 
I use [klass](https://github.com/ded/klass), 
[selfish](https://github.com/Gozala/selfish),
[backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), or something similar.
No need to reinvent the wheel. This repo is just me trying to 
understand the concepts better.

A note on code style
--------------------

I've tried to keep all the javascript coded according to the
[Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://bit.ly/bQ1NKf), and all javascript
should pass the [Google Linter](http://bit.ly/gjslint) in `--strict` mode.

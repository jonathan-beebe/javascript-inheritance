Javascript Inheritance
======================

What this is
------------

This is a compilation of research I've done on javascript inheritance and using
getters and setters within my class definitions.

What can you do with it?
------------------------

I'm [sharing it freely](http://unlicense.org/) with you. Please use, tweak,
fork, hack, learn from, and if you find a bug or improvement, give back.

If you have an improvement, comment, or other feedback please let me know at
somethingkindawierd at gmail dot com.

Enjoy :)

A note on code style
--------------------

I've tried to keep all the javascript coded according to the
[Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://bit.ly/bQ1NKf), and all javascript
should pass the [Google Linter](http://bit.ly/gjslint) in `--strict` mode.
